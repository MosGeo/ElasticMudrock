function Clustering = kmedoids(D,nbclusters,nbrep)

%% Input Parameters
%   - D: distance matrix to use
%   - nbclusters: number of clusters to construct
%   - nbrep: (optional). Number of kmedoid to be performed. The best cluster 
%                       configuration is returned

%% Output Parameters 
%   - Clustering: Results of the clustering, which contains:
%        - label: is a vector of length Nbmodels, which contains the cluster index that each model belongs to
%        - medoids: is a vector of length nbcluster containing the index
%                   of the medoids
%        - weights: is a vector of ength nbcluster containing the number
%                   of models in each cluster.
